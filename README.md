### _A light package for fast detecting the geo-electrical features_

## Problematic 
`kalfeat`(stands for [Kouadio et al.](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021wr031623) features detection) is designed for predicting the groundwater flow rate from the geology and DC resistivity data. In developing countries, during the campaigns for drinking water supply (CDWS), the DC-resistivity method is mostly used especially the electrical resistivity profiling (ERP) for detecting the conductive zone and the vertical Electrical sounding (VES) to speculate about the existence of the fracture before proposing a drilling point. However, despite both methods, the accurate drilling point after ERP and VES was not always the best and faced some difficulties. To fight against choice, some geological companies try to propose a least three points the maximize their chance to get least the flow rate required (FRR) by the project dependent on the number of living population in the survey area.  This trick has two shortcomings. First, one unsuccessful borehole coast at least 22 US, which is an expensive loss especially when the CDWS covers at least 2000 villages. Secondly, if all three proposed points do not give the FRR, the local companies must take the whole fees charges to make a new survey. This occasionally creates a loss of investments from partners and governments. The last problem is the presence of unsustainable boreholes after the drilling operations.  Indeed, unsustainable boreholes are boreholes that dried up after a few years of use. This is a critial issue when using the traditional criteria (criteria mostly used by geophysicists to speculate about the goodness of the proposed drilling point) for determining the expected drilling points using ERP and VES. 

## Purpose 
Faced with the evidence problems enumerated above, `kalfeat` is designed to bring a piece solution in the detection of the geo-electrical features which are known as the foremost criteria to select the right location before any drilling locations. The aim of `kalfeat` is twofold: 
1. to minimize the rate of unsuccessful drillings after the geological survey during CDWS and save money from geophysical and drilling companies. 
2. maximize the number of boreholes intended for the populations and encourage the partners to indirectly solve the problem of water scarcity
